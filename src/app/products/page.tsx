          A/C condenser is one of the air conditioner parts that need to be checked whenever the temperature it provides becomes abnormal, so to maintain utmost operation. If the radiator of the automobile works hard to maintain the temperature of the engine, the a/c condenser works just as hard for the air conditioning system by keeping the refrigerant cool.
